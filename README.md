# Repository: Home-Lab-Networking-Pentesting-Linux

## 1. README.md

```markdown
# Home Lab Projects — Networking, Pentesting & Linux Administration

Welcome to my Home Lab repository, where I document practical projects and experiments focused on networking, penetration testing, and Linux system administration. This lab is designed to build real-world skills through hands-on experience, using virtualized environments and industry-standard tools.

---

## Lab Environment Setup

- **Host OS:** Windows 10/11
- **Virtualization:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Hardware:** 8-core CPU, 8 GB RAM, SSD storage
- **VMs Used:** Kali Linux, Windows 10, Cisco router/firewall simulations
- **Network Configuration:** Internal Networking for isolated, secure testing

---

## Key Skills & Tools Practiced

- **Networking:** Cisco device configuration, routing, switching, firewall setup
- **Pentesting:** Vulnerability scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark
- **Linux Administration:** Shell scripting (Bash), user management, system updates, service configuration
- **Automation & Scripting:** Python scripts for task automation and pentesting workflows
- **Documentation:** Detailed reports and walkthroughs of pentesting engagements and network configurations

## How to Use This Repository

1. Review the documentation and reports in `/docs` to understand methodologies and outcomes.
2. Explore the `/scripts` folder for automation tools and examples.
3. Use the VM configuration notes and Cisco setup guides for replicating the environment.
4. Follow best practices demonstrated to build your own home lab or enhance professional skills.

---

## Goals

- Develop and demonstrate a strong foundation in cybersecurity, networking, and Linux system administration.
- Create a portfolio of reproducible projects that showcase practical, employer-ready skills.
- Continuously update and refine lab environments to stay current with industry trends.

## 2. /docs/pentest-reports/README.md

```markdown
# Penetration Test Reports

This folder contains detailed reports of penetration testing exercises performed in the home lab environment. Each report includes:

- Target description
- Tools used
- Vulnerabilities discovered
- Exploitation steps
- Remediation recommendations

Reports are designed to demonstrate practical pentesting skills and methodologies.
```

---

## 3. /network-configs/README.md

```markdown
# Network Configurations

This folder contains Cisco router and firewall configuration files used in lab simulations. The configurations demonstrate:

- Basic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP)
- VLAN setup and management
- Firewall rules and NAT
- Network segmentation for pentesting environments
```
